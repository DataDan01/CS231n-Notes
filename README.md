# CS231n Notes - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

## Overview

This repo is meant to record my code and notes from [Stanford's CS231n class](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/). I will also use this repo to experiment with the ideas presented in the class. I previously attempted to build my own neural network in R but was missing some key theory. That project can be found [here](https://github.com/DataDan01/Daniel-s-Neural-Network-Adventures). Assets were copied from [CS231n's GitHub](https://github.com/cs231n/cs231n.github.io).

Thanks for browsing!
